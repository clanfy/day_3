Homework

A. Given the following data structure:

lines = ['Gyle Centre', 'Edinburgh Park', 'Murrayfield Stadium', 'Haymarket', 'Princes Street']

Work out how many stops there are in the current west array
lines.length
lines.count

Return 'Edinburgh Park' from the array
lines[1]

How many ways can we return 'Princes Street' from the array?
lines[4]
lines.last
lines[-1]

Work out the index position of 'Haymarket'
lines.index("Haymarket")

Add 'Airport' to the start of the array
lines.unshift("Airport")

Add 'York Place' to the end of the array
lines << "York Place"

Remove 'Edinburgh Park' from the array using it's name
lines.delete("Edinburgh Park")

Delete 'Edinburgh Park' from the array by index
(if it wasn't deleted from the previous question) lines.delete_at(2)

Reverse the positions of the stops in the array
lines.reverse!

Print out all of the stops using a for loop and a while loop
for stops in lines do
  puts stops
end

GO BACK AND DO THE WHILE LOOP HERE

B. Given the following data structure:

  my_hash = {0 => "Zero", 1 => "One", :two => "Two", "two" => 2}
How would you return the string "One"?
How would you return the string "Two"?
How would you return the number 2?
How would you add {3 => "Three"} to the hash?
How would you add {:four => 4} to the hash?
